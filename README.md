2. Matrix Operations
3. Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
4. Inverse of a Matrix
5. Determinants
6. Properties of Determinants
7. Vector Spaces
8. Subspaces
9. Span and Linear Independence
10. Basis and Dimension
11. Inner Product Spaces
12. Linear Transformations
13. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
14. Symmetric Matrices and Orthogonal Diagonalization
15. Quadratic Forms
16. Singular Value Decomposition


Discrete Math: 
Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science

1. Prepositional Logic
2. Predicate Logic
3. Proofs
4. Mathematical Induction
5. Set Theory
6. Functions
7. Relations
8. Partial Order Relations
