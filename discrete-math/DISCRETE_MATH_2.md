## Finding Examples, Computer Search, Optimality

### How to find an example
  - We have stated that one example is enough to prove an existential statement, but of course we need to find this example
  - Sometimes it's difficult to find the example
  - Following are some examples and trick that can be used
  - Magic Squares
    - Table with numbers, sum is the same for all four columns, rows, and the two diagonals
    - Combinatronics, permutations of nine 9 digits 9 x 8 x ... x 1 = 362,880
  - Multiplicative Magic Squares
    - Cannot use sequential
    - Product to be used
    - Seven appears in some products, exponentiation, additive square to multiplicative
  - More puzzles
    - Simple but shows different side
    - Six-digit number starting by 100 and divisible by 9127
  - Ex. Find an integer n such that n^2 = 31415
    - Finite decimal fraction is enough
    - (10x)^2 = 100x^2
    - square root (31415) = 177.242771
    - 177.242771^2 = 31414.9998
    - shift decimal on left over three position, six position on right
      - 177.243^2 = 31415.081049 (six positions)
  - Integer Linear Combination
    - Ex. Image a country with 7/13 florin coins. Two people each have many coins of each type. Can one pay florin to the other?
      - 6 = 13 -7 
      - How about one florin?
        - 2(7) - 13 = 1
      - Bottom up approach or 7 - 6 =1  ~ capitalize what you already know
      - 7x + 13y = c has integer solutions
      - every integer can be an integer linear combination
    - Ex. 15/21 coins how to pay 6?
      - 6 = 21 - 15
      - Can we pay 8 florins using 15 & 21 florin coinds
      - Euclid's Algorithm - Number Theory
  - Switching from Number Theory to Graph Theory
    - Hotel A(10), B(15), C(20) - change every night for 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 nights
    - Repeat five times a path of length nine
    - initial point different from
    - Impossible task
      - A(10), B(15), C(30) 
      - Too many vouchers for C, can't alternate at least one less than largest
      
### Computer Search
  - Puzzle: N Queens
    - Place N queens such that no two attack each other
  - Computer Search
    - To prove an object satisying some particular properties exist
    - Cases when a solution exists, but not easy to construct by hand
    - Computer do the job!
  - N-Queen Puzzle
    - Queen moves vertically, horizontally, diagonally
    - NxN chessboard no two queens can attack each other
    - N >= 4
    - N = 8 not easy to construct a solution 
  - Speculating
    - Represent a particular solution
    - Every column must be at least at most queen
    - Strictly less than N queen
    - Each row exactly an queen
  - Design a formula same diagonal
  - iterate through all permutations
  - Optimization - N Queens: Backtracking
    - Backtracking: construct a permutation piece by piece, solution piece by piece
    - 1) Queen first row
    - 2) Second row
    - 3) If no way to place (readjust) - backtracking
    - backtrack if current partial permutation cannot be extend to valid solution
  - Generate all possible permutation N Queens: Backtracking
  - Combine methods already impelemted, method whether solution or not, have a partial permutation
  - Main idea of backtracking: cut dead ends of recursion tree
    - since many ends are dead, it works faster than an enurmeration of all permutation
 
### Optimality 
  - Optimality Value alpha
  - A proof of the fact that some value alpha is optimal usually consisting of two parts
    - 1) Existential statment: exists a solution achieving the value alpha
    - 2) Universal statement: solution achieve not greater than alpha
  - e.g. Rooks on a Chessboard, Knights on a Chessboard, Bishops on a Chessboard, Final Optimality #3
