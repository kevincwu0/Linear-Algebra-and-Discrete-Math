# Why Proofs? 

- So why do we need proof to prove something? For mathematician, proofs are their main tool. They always prove something. For programmers it's not the case actually.
- If you write a video game, you probably won't prove anything. But it's not always the case. For example, if you try to write a cryptographic protocol which is secure, it's good if it's provably secure. It's indeed a big part of computer science. 
- But first, what does it prove? 
  - people often view proofs as a long formal meaningless manipulation
  - not at all: an argument that is so convincing that you ready to use it to convince other people
  - you need to understand the problems
  - are they're fun
- Objectives
  - Learn by example how to understand proofs
  - How to invent proofs
  - How to explain proofs
  - How to enjoy proofs (most important and ambitious goal)
- Believe that God has a book best possible proof - clear, nice, and fun
- "Proofs from THE BOOK" 
- Begin with a puzzle
  - Can a chessboard 8 x 8 be tiled (no overlaps or empty space by domino 1x2 tiles?
  - Yes of course and in many ways
  - Prove that without overlap (many overlaps)
  - Can we tile this board without square (63 squares)
    - we did not find a tile, we did not prove that tiling is not possible
    - Can we do one of these two proofs
- Impossibility proof 
  - Tile the board with one cell miss in 8 x 8
  - one cell will always remain
  - 63 = 8 x 8 -1 cells, an odd number 
  - 32 tiles cover 62 cells, one remains
  - mission provably impossible
- Two corners cut
  - 62 cells (but opposite corners)
  - 64 - 2 = 62 cells, 62/2 = 31 tiles...so the tiling is possible? No the argument is not okay
  - It's impossible 
- Impossibility proof pt.2
  - 64 (32 white and black) 
  - If we remove two black tiles or two white tiles, impossible
  - black and white for 1x2 tile
  - Theorem: A chess board 8 x 8 without two opposite corners cannot be tiled by 1 x 2 dominos
  - Proof: 
    - black and white cells, 4 black / 4 white (each column)
    - opposite corners are (say) black
    - 30 black and 32 white
    - a domino: two different colors
    - (at least) two white remain
    - quod erat demonstrandum
- Takeaways:
  - Proofs can be really convincing
  - What if we cut two non-opposite corners? Can we tile the rest? 
  - Bonus problem: what if any two tiles
  - Snake with our property? Cut cells of black and white how the snake can help us
  - One can reason in the following way: if you delete two cells from the snake, it is split into two parts. Since the colors were different, each part contains an even number of cells. Thereforce we can cut the parts into blocks of length 2, i.e. into tiles.

# Existence Proofs
- When one example is enough
  - E.g. unicorn 
- Proofs for Existential Statements
  - What does the proof look like?
  - It depends?
  - Claim: object with given properties exists
  - proof: an example
  - one example is enough
- Cutting figures
  - congruent pieces: of the same shape and size
  - prove that this figure into can be cut into two congruent pieces
  - cut L shape into congruent and same, no need for other examples
- Splitting an Octagon
  - Into congruent parts, split
  - What about three congruent pieces?
- Example of real life
  - E.g. Tensegrities (Tension and integrity) 
  - Lots of threads and straws, goal to create a solid structure
  - a solid construction made from sticks that are connected by pieces of rope in such a way that the sticks do not touch each other and the entire construction is solid
  - none of the straws are not touching, tensegrities
- Know your rights 
  - Protect your sources
    - Imagine you want to find a two-digit number that becomes 7 times smaller when the first digit is deleted
    - 35 = 7 * 5
    - must be divisble by 7
    - What if we asked for a number becomes 57 times smaller when the first digit is deleted
  - Explain how to find the solution
    - 7125 is the answer
    - ab....z = 57 x b .. z
    - X = b...z
    - X + a^(0...0) (k) - K zeros
    - X = b...z has k digits
    - a * 10^k + X = 57 * X
    - a * 10^k = 56 * X = 7 * 8 * X
      - we have 7 on the right
      - left had side 2^k * 5^k
      - so a = 7 , no other possibilities
      - a divisible by 7: only a = 7 works
      - 10^k = 8 * X; 10 and 100 not multiples of 8
      - 1000 works, X = 125
      - Also 71250 = 57 * 1250
 - Nobody Can Win All the Times
  - Splitting Weights
    - preparing for height, same backpack, many items for the hike, 
    - split into same weight
    - 1 + 2 = 3
    - +/- 1 +/- 2 +/- 3 = 0
    - + 1 + 2 - 3 = 0
    - e.g. 1,2,3,4,5, 7
    - total weight: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22
    - each group should 11, find 11 and you're done
    - easy 4 + 7 (also 1 + 2 + 3 + 5)
    - obstacles 1,2,3,4,5,6
    - total weight 21 cannot split into two groups, 21 is not a multiple of 2
    - e.g. 2,4,6,8,10,12
  - Bad news
    - 1,2,3,4,5,17
    - 32, but 16 is half, but 17 is too big...
    - obstacles of different types
    - no complete list, some rule into two group the sum is even etc. some conditions (but this is not the case)
    - NP-complete = infeasible problem
    - 10,000 numbers no way can split into two numbers
    - we cannot prove that an algorithm exists
    - whether there is an algorithm to solve this splitting weight problem
    - boundary is close, NP-complete problems
 - Take-home Message
  - The structure of the proof reflects the structure of the claim
  - claim: an object with some property exists
  - proof: an example (existential argument)
  - no obligation to find the example (from your friend, mathematical proof by bad tools)
  - beware: claim may be false!
